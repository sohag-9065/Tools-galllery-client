                            <p>Every object has an internal and hidden property called [[Prototype]] that is present in all of its methods and properties. </p>
                            <p>Prototypal Inheritance is a javascript feature that allows you to add methods and properties to objects. It's an object for an object to take on the characteristics and methods of another. We use Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.setPrototypeOf to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object, respectively. It is now set using __proto__ in current programming languages. </p>

                            <p>React state can be some types:</p>
                            <p>Local state , Global State. We can manage local state by using useState Ohterwise there is call contextAPI, with that we can handle state globally in our app and access within the context wrapper.</p>
                            <p>There is another option is using third party state management tool like redux , Mobx etc.</p>

                        <div className="px-4 pb-4 space-y-2">
                            <p>In react state is immutable, So we cannot update or replace them directly . Also react internally update state by setState function and know where to change in DOM. If we forcely update state in directly we can fall into unknown bug and react doesn't understand what to do. So keep thing what react way. :)</p>
